        <div>A hierarchal structure where the most important node is always stored at the root of the heap.

        </br>This visualiser includes a Min Heap where the smallest node is kept at the root, and a Max Heap, where the largest node is kept at the root.

        <div>Red Black trees have the same properties as a BST with the additon of node colouring.
